# .Net-Maui-Samples

This project contains custom controls and samples built with .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI).

.NET MAUI is a cross-platform framework for creating mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared codebase.

## Description

The purposes of the project are threefold:
* It provides a learning playground for the team to get familiar with .Net Maui Framework
* It helps the team to test individual features and minimize potential risks before implementing them in the future product
* In the long run, it will be a great studying material for future hires to learn and grow

## Project structure

It should contain Control library (UI, Framework, ArcGIS Runtime, Helpers) and Samples.

TODO: Add the project structure

### Dependencies

* [ArcGIS Maps SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/)
ArcGIS Maps SDK for .NET was previously known as ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET. It builds on the proven architecture of ArcGIS Runtime 100.x, and is designed to leverage the latest developer framework innovations. It includes support for .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI), Microsoft's cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps.


* [MVVM Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/mvvm/introduction)
MVVM Toolkit provides access to a collection of standard, self-contained, lightweight types that provide a starting implementation for building modern apps using the MVVM pattern.


* [.NET MAUI Community Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/maui/)
The .NET MAUI Community Toolkit is a collection of common elements for development with .NET MAUI that developers tend to replicate across multiple apps. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks when building apps with .NET MAUI.
